        <h2 id="faq">FAQs</h2>
          <h3>Do I need any coding experience?</h3>
          <p>No, no experience is needed. But you will need to have an understanding of very basic computer skills, such as how to access an email account, how to save images to your desktop, the difference between left and right clicking, and the copy and paste keyboard shortcuts.</p>
          <p>You can also prepare for a camp or class by sharpening your typing skills! Fast fingers are a coder's best friends.</p>
          <h3>Do I need to take Web Development I before I take Web Development II?</h3>
          <p>Yes, we do recommend starting with Web Development I, unless you have significant HTML & CSS experience.</p>
          <h3>Do I need to take either Web Development camp or class before taking Mobile Programming?</h3>
          <p>No, there are no prerequisites for Mobile Programming.</p>
          <h3>What do I need to bring with me to camp or class?</h3>
          <p>Every student should have a wifi-enabled laptop and power cord. Friends or siblings can share a computer, if need be. If your child does not have a laptop, consider a Chromebook, a great machine for under $200.</p>
          <p>Students should also bring a snack and water bottle. And be sure to set up an email account ahead of time. (And know your password!)</p>
          <h3>Where and when will summer camp be held?</h3>
          <p>Summer 2016 camps will be held from 9 a.m. to noon at Next High School, 2000 Wade Hampton Blvd., Greenville, SC 29615. Please arrive by 8:45 a.m. the first day of camp so we can check everyone in and give parents some instruction.</p>
          <h3>Who can I contact with questions?</h3>
          <p>Email us at hello@code-prep.com with any questions!</p>
